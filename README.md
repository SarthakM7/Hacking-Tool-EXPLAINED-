# Hacking-Tool-EXPLAINED-

You can build your own complete security and ethical hacking tool from scratch on Python. </br>
Includes MAC changer, net scanner, MITM framework, packet listener, keylogger and a backdoor(socket listener and soket). </br>
Source: Atil Samancioglu's Ethical Hacking Course </br>

*** I have explained almost every line of code. *** </br>

1)MAC changer: To change your own MAC-address. </br>
2)Network scanner and MITM: To perform network scanning followed by Man In The Middle attack (ARP Poisoning). </br>
3)Packet Listener: To intercept all the packets of victim's computer. Can downgrade https to http as well before interception. </br>
4)Keylogger: Reads each and every keyboard input (keys pressed by victim) and stores it in a log. Mails all the log to your email id. (Reading of mouse inputs not implemented yet) </br>
5)Backdoor: Created a backdoor and a listener. Can send data from victim's system to ours and vice-versa. We can run cmd commands on victim's system from our pc. </br>
6)Packaging Malacious Files: Can convert any python program into .exe file. Can attach the file to any pdf or image. Can make the python code run on the victim's system, everytime the user restarts the pc. For example: you can make the keylogger application run everytime victim's pc restarts. </br>

Feel free to report errors. Give a star if you liked it. </br>
Cheers.
